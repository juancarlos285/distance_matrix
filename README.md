# Using Google Maps Distance Matrix API to create a distance table and store it in a data base

In the summer of 2021 I worked on a logistics project for a civil engineering company in which I was tasked with finding distances between warehouses and delivery points. Considering there were hundreds of delivery points, using Google Maps manually to find the distance from each origin to multiple destinations was going to be extremely time consuming. Fortunately, I came across the Google Maps APIs and with some Python and SQL knowledge, I was able to build a program to more efficiently generate the needed distance data.
